########## GUI tabs

# Info
gui.tab.info=Information
gui.tab.info.assistIGW=For more info, install the In-Game Wiki Mod.

gui.tab.info.tubeModule=§0In this interface you can exactly define how a module should behave dependent on the redstone signal. You can define a formula.
gui.tab.info.heat=This machine requires or produces heat. Heat can be applied by placing a block that generates heat next to this machine. Think of a Vortex Tube (fast, but requires power), but also Lava (slow) and Torches (very slow). To cool down a machine, remove the heat sources and/or speed up the process by placing down Ice.
gui.tab.info.items=Add plastic in the bottom slot. In this slot plastic also will be put when it cools down into plastic. Add dye in the top slot. Note that when mixing dye with plastic, dye has a much lower effect than mixing another color of Plastic.
gui.tab.info.heat.title=Heat
gui.tab.info.ghostSlotInteraction=Interaction: \nAdd 1: right-click \nSubtract 1: left-click \nDouble: Sneak + right-click \nHalf: Sneak + left-click \nClear: Middle-click
gui.tab.info.ghostSlotInteraction.title=Slot interaction
gui.tab.liquidCompressor.fuel=Available Fuels

gui.tab.info.tile.aerialInterface=§0By using an advanced technology which compresses items so much they become as small as atoms, this machine can use a player's inventory as its own. This means you can hopper items in and out of this machine, and they will be added or removed to the inventory of the player who placed the block. Smarter insertion methods like (the mod) Translocators could be used to keep the player's inventory supplied with 64 torches for example.
gui.tab.info.tile.airCannon=§0This machine can be used to transport items through the air. To be able to use it you'll have to make a GPS Tool. Once made, right click with it on the block you want the items to travel to, and insert the GPS Tool in the GPS slot.
gui.tab.info.aerialInterface.liquidXp.info.title=Interfacing XP
gui.tab.info.aerialInterface.liquidXp.info=§0When you've got a Dispenser Upgrade installed in the Aerial Interface, you can pump liquid XP into or out of the Aerial Interface. When there are multiple options, you can learn the Interface which one to pump out by pumping a bit of the liquid you want in. The supported liquids you can use in your instance are:
gui.tab.info.aerialInterface.interfacingRF.info.title=Interfacing RF
gui.tab.info.aerialInterface.interfacingRF.info=The Aerial Interface is able to accept RF. The RF stored in its internal buffer (100,000RF) is used to charge any chargeable RF item in the player's inventory (and armor slots).

gui.tab.info.tile.pressureTube=§0This block is used to transport air. It supports ForgeMultipart and Tube Modules can be placed on it to provide additional functionality.
gui.tab.info.tile.advancedPressureTube=§0This block is used to transport air. It is the high tier version of the Pressure Tube. It supports ForgeMultipart and Tube Modules can be placed on it to provide additional functionality.
gui.tab.info.tile.pressureChamberWall.wall=§0This block is used to create a Pressure Chamber. Create a hollow 3x3x3 structure with one Pressure Chamber Valve connecting to the inner air block, pointing to the air block. Pressure Chamber Walls and Pressure Chamber Windows can be used interchangeably.
gui.tab.info.tile.pressureChamberWall.window=§0This block is used to create a Pressure Chamber. Create a hollow 3x3x3 structure with one Pressure Chamber Valve connecting to the inner air block, pointing to the air block. Pressure Chamber Walls and Pressure Chamber Windows can be used interchangeably.
gui.tab.info.tile.pressureChamberValve=§0This multi-block structure can be used as air storage. The main feature however is to compress various materials into others. Like coal into diamonds.
gui.tab.info.tile.elevatorFrame=§0This block needs to be stacked on top of an Elevator Base to create a working Elevator.
gui.tab.info.tile.airCompressor=§0This machine is used to generate compressed air. To do this insert any item that can burn in a Furnace in the fuel slot.
gui.tab.info.tile.advancedAirCompressor=§0This machine is the tier two version of the Air Compressor. Like its less resistant brother it can generate compressed air using any fuel that can burn in a Furnace. However, this one generates at 50mL/tick, and also produces heat. The higher the heat, the lower the efficiency. The bottom arrow in the temperature gauge indicates where the efficiency will start to drop, and the top arrow indicates the 0%% efficiency mark. \n \nUnlike you might expect from this mod, this machine won't explode when the temperature gets too high.
gui.tab.info.tile.chargingStation=§0This machine is used to (dis)charge items which operate on pneumatic power, for instance, Drones, Pneumatic Wrenches or Vortex Cannons.
gui.tab.info.tile.elevatorBase=§0This machine is like the name says an elevator. You can use this to transport any entities. For it to work you'll need some air pressure and Elevator Frames on top of this block to support the elevator. To control the height level apply a redstone signal or use Elevator Callers. A redstone strength of 0 equals 0%% extension, a strength of 15 equals 100%% extension. \n \nYou can extend your elevators sideways. When you connect them in a way that the topmost Elevator Base for every elevator is at the same height, they will share the floor names/desired heights. \n \nYou can camouflage the floor of the elevator by putting in a block in the top slot in the camo section. Camouflaging the Elevator Frames can be done by putting in a block in the bottom slot. Camouflaging Elevator Callers can be done by shift right-clicking the Caller with a block in your hand.
gui.tab.info.item.pneumaticHelmet=§0On its own this helmet is as good as an Iron Helmet. However, on this helmet you can install various upgrades.
gui.tab.info.item.pneumaticHelmet.searchUpgrade=§0The Search Upgrade allows you to search for a specific item in (for example) your base. This upgrade depends on the Block Tracker, to be able to find the item existing in inventories, and on the Entity Tracker, which allows it to find the searched item when it lies on the ground. To experience the full effect of the upgrade you should install both these upgrades.
gui.tab.info.item.pneumaticHelmet.coordinateTracker=§0The Coordinate Tracker upgrade allows you to track one specific coordinate, which can be used for example when you are tunneling to a certain location, without knowing the exact place this location is at in relation to where you are at that moment. Meant for people that don't like to use F3. As second feature this upgrade will use Minecraft's entity pathfinding to navigate you to wherever you want.
gui.tab.info.item.pneumaticHelmet.entityTracker=§0With the Entity Tracker upgrade in, the helmet is able to track any living entity within a range of 16 blocks. These entities don't have to be visible, making this upgrade a perfect way to prevent Creepers sneaking up on you.
gui.tab.info.item.pneumaticHelmet.blockTracker=§0With the Block Tracker you'll be able to track Chests, Mob Spawners, Furnaces, Silverfish Blocks, Tripwires, Dispensers, TNT and End Portal Blocks within a range of 30 blocks. This way Dungeons, Fortresses and temples can easily be found. Inventories even can be remotely explored, as hovering over one of these indicators will show their inventories.
gui.tab.info.item.drone=§0In this interface you can insert upgrades into the Drone. Open up other tabs to see which enhancements can be done.
gui.tab.info.item.drone.speedUpgrade=§0Per Speed Upgrade inserted, the moving speed of the Drone will increase by 10%% of it's original moving speed. This can stack up to 10 upgrades, meaning 200%% speed is the max.
gui.tab.info.item.drone.dispenserUpgrade=§0By default the Drone can transfer one stack of items. For every Dispenser Upgrade inserted, the Drone can transfer one additional stack. \n \nIt will also increase the internal liquid tank by 16000mB per upgrade, and 100000RF storage per upgrade (if installed). It also increases the rate at which the Drone can transfer RF (transfer = max storage / 100).
gui.tab.info.item.drone.itemLifeUpgrade=§0With the Item Life Upgrade inserted, the Drone will be able to auto-repair. It will regen health over time. The more upgrades you insert, the stronger the effect (up to 6 upgrades).
gui.tab.info.item.drone.securityUpgrade=§0With one of this upgrade inserted, the Drone will be capable of being immune to liquids. Liquids around the Drone will be removed by the Drone's forcefield.
gui.tab.info.item.drone.volumeUpgrade=§0For each upgrade inserted, the Drone's volume will be increased by 5000mL. This could be used for long travels.
gui.tab.info.item.drone.entityUpgrade=§0When inserted, the Drone will have a minigun attached to it, allowing it to perform ranged attacks (up to 16 blocks from the target) when an Entity Attack piece is used. Gun Ammo is required to fire, which needs to be imported with an Inventory Import piece.
gui.tab.info.item.drone.rangeUpgrade=§0Increases the range of the ranged attacks of the Drone (requiring an Entity Tracker Upgrade) by one block per upgrade (up to 16 upgrades).
gui.tab.info.tile.pressureChamberInterface=§0This block can be used to export and import items in and out of a Pressure Chamber. You select whether it's exporting or importing by how you place the block. The 'I' means it's Importing on that side, 'O' means it's Outputting. Use the filter slots to select which items are allowed to be imported/exported.
gui.tab.info.tile.vacuumPump=§0This machine is used to achieve a vacuum. To do this this machine uses pressurized air. Apply pressurized air at the '+' tube, and when 2 bar is reached, air at the '-' tube will be sucked.
gui.tab.info.tile.assemblyController=§0This machine is used to control other assembly machines. It can control any connected assembly machine, and the machines connecting these assembly machines, and so on... To start the assembly put a program in the program slot.
gui.tab.info.tile.assemblyIOUnit=§0Part of an Assembly line. Imports items from an inventory to an Assembly Platform, or exports items to an inventory. Hit it with a wrench to switch between the modes.
gui.tab.info.tile.assemblyPlatform=§0Part of an Assembly line. Holds the items so that they can be drilled/lasered.
gui.tab.info.tile.assemblyDrill=§0Part of an Assembly line. Can drill items on an Assembly Platform adjacent to it. It cannot be set up diagonally in relation to the Assembly Platform!
gui.tab.info.tile.assemblyLaser=§0Part of an Assembly line. Can laser items on an Assembly Platform adjacent to it. It cannot be set up diagonally in relation to the Assembly Platform!
gui.tab.info.tile.uvLightBox=§0With this machine you can expose Empty PCB's to UV light. If this happens in such a way that only a part of the PCB gets exposed, this part will hold it's copper traces when etched in an Etching tank. The longer you expose a PCB, the higher the chance that the PCB will be successfully etched.
gui.tab.info.tile.securityStation=§0When you want to protect an area from others messing around with your belongings, you can use this block to prevent others from interacting/breaking with every block within its range. You can whitelist players by adding them in the Access Stat. There's no in-game tutorial available just yet for how to set up the network.
gui.tab.info.tile.securityStation.hacking=§0In here you can hack a Security Station. You start at the IO Port. From there, you can hack Network Nodes by left-clicking on them. Every time you do so, you have a chance to be detected by the Diagnostic Subroutine, which then will initiate a trace. You lose when the Subroutine has found your IO Port. You win when you've either hacked every Subroutine or every Registry.
gui.tab.info.tile.securityStation.stopWorm=§0With a STOP! Worm you can stop a Diagnostic Subroutine from tracing you for 5 seconds. This software will be used in the process. To use it click on the STOP! Worm icon on the right when you are detected (else it would serve no purpose).
gui.tab.info.tile.securityStation.nukeVirus=§0The Nuke Virus is a consumable item which can be used to insta-capture (without time loss) a Network Node without any chance of being detected by the Diagnostic Subroutine. This also works with every other Network component. To use it, middle-click a hackable node.
gui.tab.info.securityStationHacking=§0In here you can hack a Security Station. You start at the IO Port. From there, you can hack Network Nodes by left-clicking on them. Every time you do so, you have a chance to be detected by the Diagnostic Subroutine, which then will initiate a trace. You lose when the Subroutine has found your IO Port. You win when you've either hacked every Subroutine or every Registry.
gui.tab.info.tile.universalSensor=§0Like the name suggests, you can use this device as sensor in many applications. To select a sensor, put in the right Upgrades and navigate through the folder structure. Sensors are marked with a yellow button text. The Block and GPS Tool sensors emit a redstone signal dependent on a location. When two GPS Tools are inserted, the locations of the Tools form the corners of a box, and every coordinate in this box is used in the measurement. The measuring interval is decreased when using multiple coordinates (does not apply for event based sensors like the Player right click sensor). Both GPS Tools need to be in range of the sensor.
gui.tab.info.tile.pneumaticGenerator=§0This machine is only useful when having IndustrialCraft 2 installed. The machine's sole purpose is to convert compressed air into IC2's EU. You can interact with this machine with an IC2 Wrench just like any other IC2 machine.
gui.tab.info.tile.electricCompressor=§0This machine is only useful when having IndustrialCraft 2 installed. The machine's sole purpose is to convert IC2's EU into compressed air. You can interact with this machine with an IC2 Wrench just like any other IC2 machine.
gui.tab.info.tile.electrostaticCompressor=§0In the real world it has been stated it's incredibly difficult to do, in this world it's a reality: creating energy from lightning. When this machine gets hit by lightning, it produces 200000mL instantly. To increase the chance that the machine will be hit, you can make a grid of Iron Bars and attach it to this machine. The bolt will then travel through the bars into the machine.
gui.tab.info.tile.pneumaticDoorBase=§0This machine, when placed next to a Pneumatic Door, will automatically open the door when there are players nearby. When the Pneumatic Door Base is within range of a Security Station, the Pneumatic Door Base will only react to players which are allowed by the Security Station. Place any normal block in the camo slot to make the block look like that block.
gui.tab.info.tile.pneumaticDoor=§0This block is used together with a Pneumatic Door Base to form a working door contraption.
gui.tab.info.tile.omnidirectionalHopper=§0Did you ever want to use Hoppers to extract items from an other side than the bottom of an inventory? Or did you wish that the Hopper was transfering items faster? Then this Omnidirectional Hopper is for you. Apart from that you can place it in any direction you want, it can also be upgraded like other PneumaticCraft machines.
gui.tab.info.tile.fluxCompressor=§0This block can convert Redstone Flux into compressed air. By default it has an efficiency of 40%%. The input RF rate is twice the amount of Flux used per tick to generate air.
gui.tab.info.tile.pneumaticDynamo=§0This block can convert compressed air into Redstone Flux. By default it has an efficiency of 40%%. The output RF rate is twice the amount of Flux created per tick.
gui.tab.info.tile.liquidCompressor=§0This machine can generate compressed air using various liquids. To see every possible fuel open up the 'Available Fuels' tab. This tab is ordered from best to worst fuel. \n \nYou can either pump in fuel, right click with a fluid container (like a bucket) on the Liquid Compressor, or put the fluid container in the top slot.
gui.tab.info.tile.advancedLiquidCompressor=§0This machine is the tier two version of the Liquid Compressor. Like its less resistant brother it can generate compressed air using liquid fuel (all useable fuels can be seen in the 'Available Fuels' tab). However, this one generates at 50mL/tick, and also produces heat. The higher the heat, the lower the efficiency. The bottom arrow in the temperature gauge indicates where the efficiency will start to drop, and the top arrow indicates the 0%% efficiency mark. \n \nUnlike you might expect from this mod, this machine won't explode when the temperature gets too high.
gui.tab.info.tile.plasticMixer=§0The Plastic Mixer is used to melt down Plastic into liquid plastic. Using red, green and blue dye any other color of Plastic can be crafted. Just supply these dyes and click on the desired color of Plastic in the 'Plastic Selection' tab. Note that White Plastic doesn't require any dye.
gui.tab.info.tile.liquidHopper=§0The Liquid Hopper is a hopper which you can use to transfer liquids. Like the Omnidirectional Hopper it's omnidirectional. \n \nApart from transfer liquids from one tank to another, the Liquid Hopper will try to empty any liquid container (like a Bucket) lying at the input side. Likewise it'll try to fill any liquid container at the output side.
gui.tab.info.tile.programmableController=§0A Programmable Controller is a machine you can use as a replacement for a Drone. Program either a Network API or Drone and place it in the gear slot. At a high air rate the machine will execute about any command. Items and liquids can be interfaced through the block as well as through commands. The benefit of the machine is that it does not involve any entity pathfinding.
gui.tab.info.tile.gasLift=§0A Gas Lift is a type of pump which uses pressure to pump up liquids. When placed down it requires pressure and Pressure Tubes to operate. The Gas Lift will place Pressure Tubes downwards until it hits a liquid. When solid blocks are encountered they will be dug. The pressure required to operate increases proportionally to the working depth.
gui.tab.info.tile.refinery=§0A Refinery is used to process Oil into different fuels, sorted from heavy to light: Diesel, Kerosene, Gasoline, LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas). LPG is used in a Thermopneumatic Processing Plant to produce Plastic. \n \nEither 2, 3 or 4 Refineries need to be stacked on top of each other to work. With two Refineries Diesel is produced in the bottom Refinery, and LPG in the top. With 4 Refineries all fuels are produced. The latter is much more efficient. The more heat you apply to the Refinery the faster it runs.
gui.tab.info.tile.thermopneumaticProcessingPlant=§0A Thermopneumatic Processing Plant is used to process liquids in other liquids. LPG and Coal together in this machine can produce Liquid Plastic. It can also be used in fuel cracking. Heavy fuels can be cracked into lighter ones. This means Diesel can be turned into Kerosene, Kerosene into Gasoline and Gasoline into LPG.
gui.tab.info.tile.compressedIronBlock=§0A block used as crafting component. Apart from that it serves as an excellent heat conductor.
gui.tab.info.tile.aphorismTile=§0This block acts as a sign. However, it is capable of storing theoretically infinite amounts of text. It scales the text to so the text will always fit.
gui.tab.info.tile.elevatorCaller=§0This block is used in combination with Elevator Bases and Elevator Frames.
gui.tab.info.tile.programmer=§0This block is required to program Drones. It uses puzzle pieces to define a program.
gui.tab.info.tile.creativeCompressor=§0A creative-only block used to generate any pressure you would like to test set-ups.
gui.tab.info.tile.heatSink=§0Block that disperses heat into the air. It only connects to the block it's on (not simply adjacent to). When an Air Grate Tube Module is pointed at its effectiveness is increased greatly.
gui.tab.info.tile.vortexTube=§0Splits air coming in into a heat and cold component. One side will be heated, the other cooled down. Its air usage is dependent on the pressure. Mind that the hot and cold side are connected, so it's more efficient to vent the cold side when you want to utilize the heat, and vice versa if you want to use the cold.
gui.tab.info.tile.droneInterface=§0A block that allows ComputerCraft and OpenComputers to interface with Drones.

gui.tab.info.logisticFrameRequester=§0In here you can specify which items and amounts logistical Drones should keep supplied in the framed inventory. Either put in items from your inventory or search for an item by right clicking an empty slot.
